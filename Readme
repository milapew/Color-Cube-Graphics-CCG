      <h2>Clipping Path and Multi Path Service Provider </h2>
      A Clipping Path, or deep etch of a two-dimensional image is simply known as the extraction of the said image object or product from its background. In Photoshop image editing, this is achieved by containing only the image object(s), either simple or complex inside the boundaries of the path and omitting everything else that is outside the path.

      <h2>Masking Service Provider</h2>
      Image masking is a very basic image processing procedure which involves removing or stripping the background of an image for the purpose of extracting or detaching the object out from the image. This process enables us to modify the background of an image or completely remove backgrounds which include blurry portions or thin hair strand like edges. The result is the object of an image standing out with total clarity to the viewer or customer. Achieving such a result is of total importance for maximizing advertisement and publicity of your service to the customers.

      <h2>Background Removal Service Provider</h2>
      Photo background removal is a very important part among all image editing services. It involves the removal of the background of an image without affecting the original status or face value of the photo. It is often required to swap or change the background of a photo where the background is very much undesirable or that it fails to represent the real meaning of the whole image, rendering it useless. The background may also include many unwanted objects which need to be excluded in order to express the true meaning of the image. Any kind of change to the image background can bring about a huge difference to the image in terms of value and meaning to the customers. It can also heighten the level of representation value of a brand or model.<br>

      <h2>Shadow Creation Image Shadowing Service Provider</h2>
      When an image is captured by the use of a camera by photographer, there is no guarantee of obtaining a perfect or if any shadow defining the image compared to the object in real. The resulting shadow of a photo may either be unclear, obscured or totally non-existent. When images are used for brand representation and advertisements, adding natural looking shadows to the images give them a more attractive and fresh look. Our image drop shadow service has the genuine aim to give you just that extra touch or perfect shadow additions to any of your images.<br>

These so-called manipulations may involve a task as simple as removing face marks or pimples from a model’s face image or improving the complexion of an image, to even more complex fixes like changing the subject of an image, merging several subjects together or changing appearances completely according to client needs.<br>
